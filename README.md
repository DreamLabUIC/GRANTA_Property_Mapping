# GRANTA Property Mapping - ML Models

This repository is associated with the research paper "GRANTA Property Mapping".

## Overview

In this repository, we provide machine learning models to help engineers and scientists explore relationships between Thermal, Mechanical, and Strength properties of materials. These models are trained using proprietary data from ANSYS GRANTA, which is not publicly available.

We use three different techniques:

- Neural Networks (NN)
- Geometric Harmonics (GH)
- Double Diffusion Maps (DDM)

Although the original dataset cannot be shared, the trained models are available here to make predictions on similarly structured data.

For more detailed methodology and background, please refer to the paper.

## Required Libraries

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install pandas numpy joblib tensorflow

Refer to the implementation Jupyter notebook for details on the implementation.
